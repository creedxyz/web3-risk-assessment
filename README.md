3. **Control Evaluation**: For each control, select status:
   - **Implemented**: Control is fully in place
   - **Not Implemented**: Control is missing or incomplete
   - **Not Applicable**: Control doesn't apply to this organization
4. **Add Notes**: Provide explanations and context in textarea fields
5. **Auto-save**: Data persists automatically in browser storage

### Data Management

- **Export JSON**: Download assessment data for backup or sharing
- **Import JSON**: Load previously saved assessments
- **Export PDF**: Generate professional assessment reports
- **Auto-save**: All changes saved automatically to local storage
